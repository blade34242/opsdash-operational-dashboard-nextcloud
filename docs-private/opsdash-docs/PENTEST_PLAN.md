# Pentest Plan (short)

## Scope
- `/overview/*` endpoints (load/persist/notes/presets).
- Client import/export, onboarding, and widget layout persistence.

## Runbook
1. Seed data (calendar + Deck as needed).
2. Run scripts:
   - `tools/security/run_curl_checks.sh`
   - `tools/security/import_fuzz.sh`
   - `tools/security/check_multi_user.sh`
   - `opsdash/tools/security/run_notes_csrf.sh`
3. Verify:
   - CSRF required for writes.
   - Input clamps apply server-side.
   - Profile name sanitisation holds.
   - Per-user isolation holds.

## Reporting
- Log results in `PENTEST_LOG.md`.
