> Tip: run `npm run build` before packaging so `js/.vite/manifest.json` and `js/assets/main-<hash>.js` stay in sync. All docs assume that hashed build output.

Historical references such as `CONFIGURATION.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, `SEEDING.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `TESTING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`, `INTEGRATION_TESTING.md`, `TARGETS_PLAN.md`, `TARGET_STRATEGIES.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` now live under `archive/` after being merged into `DEV_WORKFLOW.md`, `TESTING.md`, or `ROADMAP.md`.
