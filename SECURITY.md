## Reporting a Vulnerability
- **Preferred**: open a private report via GitHub Security Advisories for this repository.
- **Alternate**: email security reports to `opsdash-security@gellert-innovation.dev` (PGP optional). Please include steps to reproduce, Nextcloud version, and Opsdash version.

## Response Timeline
1. **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days.
2. **Status update** once triaged (typically within a week).
3. **Fix release** tracked via `CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Releases. If disclosure is coordinated, we’ll agree on a timeline before publishing.

Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities before we have confirmed and released a fix.
